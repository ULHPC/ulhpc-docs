      wave (PAW) method and the atomic simulation environment (ASE). It uses real-space
      uniform grids and multigrid methods or atom-centered basis-functions.

      art methods such as metadynamics, umbrella sampling and Jarzynski-equation based
      steered MD. The software, written in C++, can be easily interfaced with both
      fortran and C/C++ codes.

  LLVM:

      The LLVM Core libraries are well documented, and it is particularly easy to
      invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use LLVM as an optimizer
      and code generator.
