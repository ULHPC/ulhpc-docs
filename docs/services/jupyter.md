[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a flexible, popular literate-computing web application for creating notebooks containing code, equations, visualization, and text. Notebooks are documents that contain both computer code and rich text elements (paragraphs, equations, figures, widgets, links). They are human-readable documents containing analysis descriptions and results but are also executable data analytics artifacts. Notebooks are associated with kernels, processes that actually execute code. Notebooks can be shared or converted into static HTML documents. They are a powerful tool for reproducible research and teaching.


## Install Jupyter

While JupyterLab runs code in Jupyter notebooks for many programming languages, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the JupyterLab. New users may wish to install JupyterLab in a Conda environment. Hereafter, the `pip` package manager will be used to install JupyterLab.

We strongly recommend to use the Python module provided by the ULHPC and installing `jupyter` inside a Python virtual environment after upgrading `pip`.

```shell
$ si
$ module load lang/Python #Loading default Python
$ python -m venv ~/environments/jupyter_env
$ source ~/environments/jupyter_env/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
$ python -m pip install jupyterlab
```

!!! warning
    Modules are not allowed on the access servers. To test interactively Singularity, remember to ask for an [interactive job](../jobs/interactive.md) first using  for instance the `si` tool.

Once JupyterLab is installed along with , you can start to configure your installation setting the environment variables corresponding to your needs:

- `JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR`: Set this environment variable to use a particular directory, other than the default, for Jupyter config files
- `JUPYTER_PATH`: Set this environment variable to provide extra directories for the data search path. `JUPYTER_PATH` should contain a series of directories, separated by os.pathsep(; on Windows, : on Unix). Directories given in JUPYTER_PATH are searched before other locations. This is used in addition to other entries, rather than replacing any
- `JUPYTER_DATA_DIR`: Set this environment variable to use a particular directory, other than the default, as the user data directory
- `JUPYTER_RUNTIME_DIR`: Set this to override where Jupyter stores runtime files
- `IPYTHONDIR`: If set, this environment variable should be the path to a directory, which IPython will use for user data. IPython will create it if it does not exist.

JupyterLab is now installed and ready.

??? info "Installing the classic Notebook"
    JupyterLab (`jupyterlab`) is a new package which automates many task that where performed manually in the traditional Jupyter package (`jupyter`). If you prefer to install the classic notebook, you also need to install the [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) manually as well, replacing
    ```bash
    python -m pip install jupyterlab
    ```
    with:
    ```bash
    python -m pip install jupyter ipykernel
    ```

??? info "Managing multiple kernels"
    JupyterLab makes sure that a default [IPython kernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html#) is available, with the environment (and the Python version) with which the lab was created.

    You can [setup kernels with different environments on the same notebook](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html). Create the environment with the Python version and the packages you require, and then register the kernel in any environment with Jupyter (lab or classic notebook) installed. For instance, if we have installed Jupyter in `~/environments/jupyter_env`:
    ```shell
    source ~/environments/other_python_env/bins/activate
    python -m pip install ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --prefix=~/environments/jupyter_env --name "Other Python env"
    ```
    Then all kernels and their associated environment can be start from the same Jupyter instance.

    You can also use the flag `--user` instead of `--prefix` to install the kernel in the default system location available to all Jupyter environments.

## Starting a Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter notebooks can be started as a [slurm job](../jobs/submit.md).
The following script is an example how to proceed:

!!! example "Slurm Launcher script for Jupyter Notebook"
    ```slurm
    #!/usr/bin/bash --login
    #SBATCH --job-name=Jupyter
    #SBATCH --nodes=1
    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2 # Note that ~1.7GB RAM is proivisioned per core
    #SBATCH --partition=batch
    #SBATCH --qos=normal
    #SBATCH --time=0-01:00:00

    print_error_and_exit() { echo "***ERROR*** $*"; exit 1; }
    module purge || print_error_and_exit "No 'module' command"
    
    # Python 3.X by default (also on system)
    module load lang/Python
    source "${HOME}/environments/jupyter_env/bin/activate"

    jupyter lab --ip $(hostname -i) --no-browser &
    pid=$!
    sleep 5s
    jupyter lab list
    jupyter --paths
    jupyter kernelspec list
    echo "Enter this command on your laptop: ssh -i ~/.ssh/hpc_id_ed25519 -J ${USER}@access-iris.uni.lu:8022 -L 8888:$(hostname -i):8888 ${USER}@$(hostname -i)" > notebook.log
    wait $pid
    ```

Once your job is running (see [Joining/monitoring running jobs](../jobs/submit.md#joiningmonitoring-running-jobs)), you can use `ssh` [forwarding](../connect/ssh.md#ssh-port-forwarding) and an [ssh jump](../connect/ssh.md#ssh-jumps) through the login node to connect to the notebook from your laptop. Open a terminal on your laptop and copy-paste the ssh command in the file `notebook.log`.
You should be now able to reach your notebook.

Then open your browser and go to the url: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/`. Jupyter should ask you for a password (see screenshot below). This password can be set before running the jupyter notebook and his part of the initial configuartion detailed at [Jupyter official documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html).

if by mistake, you forgot to setup this password, have a look in the slurm-****.out file in which the output of the command `jupyter notebook list` has been recorded.
