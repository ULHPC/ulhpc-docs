# Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) 2.1

The University of Luxembourg operates since 2007 a large academic HPC facility which remains the reference implementation within the country, offering a cutting-edge research infrastructure to Luxembourg public research while serving as edge access to the upcoming Euro-HPC Luxembourg supercomputer.
The University extends access to its HPC resources (including facilities, services and HPC experts) to its students, staff, research partners (including scientific staff of national public organizations and external partners for the duration of joint research projects) and to industrial partners.
