# Cluster file systems

Several _network file systems_ are available at the UL HPC clusters and are configured for different purposes. Each server and computational resources has access to at least three different file systems with different levels of performance, permanence, and available space. This is a high level description of  the data management practices for our file systems. You can find information about performance and best usage practices in the [Storage Systems](/filesystems/) section.
