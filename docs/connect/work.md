# Working on the HPC

Now that the [SSH](./ssh.md) is setup, you can start working on the HPC. Working on the HPC is done through the command line and its not recommended to use
heavy IDEs to connect to the HPC. If you want to use an IDEs like Visual Studio Code, work on your local machine and use git or scp/rsync to transfer the files to the HPC.

To use [rsync](../data/transfer.md#using-rsync), you can add the following line to your `.bashrc` file:
```bash
uploadhpc() {
  rsync --rsh='ssh -p 8022' -avzu $1 aion-cluster:$2
}
```
This will allow you to use the `uploadhpc` command to upload files to the HPC.
To use it, you can run:
```bash
uploadhpc file.txt /path/to/destinationOnHPC
```

## Connection to HPC

When using a supercomputer, you will usually first connect to a front-end or access node. From this machine, you can check your files, disk quota and computing usage. It is intended to be used by the user to prepare his computing job and scripts and then submit them to the job scheduler.

Because the access node is shared by all the users of the platform, it should not be used to compile and install your software and it should definitely not be used to run any memory or computing-intensive task. 

!!! Warning "Running jobs on the access node"
    Running jobs on the access node is not allowed and can lead to your account being suspended. Always use the job scheduler to run your jobs on the computing nodes.


If the connection is successful, you should see something like this:

## Text Editors

When working on the HPC, you will need to edit files and scripts. The most common text editors on Linux are [`nano`](https://www.nano-editor.org/git.php), [`vim`](https://github.com/vim/vim), and [`emacs`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). Here is a brief overview of each:

### Nano

Nano is a simple and user-friendly text editor that is easy to use for beginners. It is a good choice for quick edits and small files.

- Open a file: `nano [file]`
- Save a file: `Ctrl + O`
- Exit nano: `Ctrl + X`

### Vim

Vim is a powerful and highly configurable text editor that is popular among developers and system administrators. It has a steep learning curve but offers advanced features and customization options. It is pre-installed on most Linux systems.

- Open a file: `vim [file]`
- Save a file: `:w`
- Exit vim: `:q`

Vim is different from most text editors in that it has different modes (normal, insert, visual, etc.). To enter insert mode, press `i`. To exit insert mode and return to normal mode, press `Esc`.

In normal mode, you can navigate the file using the arrow keys or `hjkl` (left, down, up, right). You can also use commands like `dd` to delete a line, `yy` to copy a line, and `p` to paste.

It is recommended to learn the basics of Vim also called vim motions to be more productive when working on the HPC.

### Emacs

Emacs is a powerful and extensible text editor that is popular among programmers and power users. It has a steep learning curve but offers advanced features and customization options.

- Open a file: `emacs [file]`
- Save a file: `Ctrl + X, Ctrl + S`
- Exit emacs: `Ctrl + X, Ctrl + C`

Emacs has a wide range of features and modes that can be customized to suit your workflow. It is highly extensible and can be used for programming, writing, and more.

### NeoVim

[NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) is a fork of Vim that aims to improve the user experience and add new features. It is compatible with Vim plugins and configurations but offers additional functionality and performance improvements.

<!--neovin-install-start-->

!!! tip "Install Neovim using Micormamba"
    Neovim is not installed by default on the HPC but you can install it using [Micromamba](../environment/conda.md#Installation).
    
    ```bash
    micromamba create --name editor-env
    micromamba install --name editor-env conda-forge::nvim
    ```
    After installation you can create a alias in your `.bashrc` for easy access:
    ```bash
    alias nvim='micromamba run --name editor-env nvim'
    ```
<!--neovin-install-end-->

NeoVim is not installed by default on most systems, but you can install it using conda/micromamba.

- Open a file: `nvim [file]`
- Save a file: `:w`
- Exit nvim: `:q`

Nvim is designed to be more user-friendly and modern than Vim while maintaining compatibility with existing Vim configurations. It is a good choice for users who want a more modern text editor with Vim-like keybindings.

It offers a lot of plugins and themes to customize the editor to your liking.
Consider watching videos or reading about it to learn more about the text editors and the many features they offer.

### Recommended Plugins for NeoVim

- [`telescope.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) for fuzzy file finding and live grep.
- [`nvim-treesitter`](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) for syntax highlighting and code analysis.
- [`nvim-tree`](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua) for file explorer.

#### Not Tested
- [`nvim-lspconfig`](nvim-lspconfig)  for language server protocol support. Most of them will probably not work on the HPC due to npm requirements or other requirements.


### How to configure NeoVim
There are many ways to configure NeoVim. The most common way is to create a `init.vim` file in the `~/.config/nvim/` directory. This file can contain your custom settings, keybindings, and plugins. It is possible to everything in one file, but it is recommended to split the configuration into multiple files for better organization.
like this:
```bash
.
|-- init.lua
|-- lazy-lock.json
`-- lua
    |-- config
    |   |-- init.lua
    |   |-- mappings.lua
    |   |-- options.lua
    |   `-- plugins.lua
    `-- plugins
        |-- cmp.lua
        |-- lualine.lua
        |-- nvim-tree.lua
        |-- telescope.lua
        |-- theme.lua
        `-- treesitter.lua
```

This makes it easier to manage and update your configuration. Consider using a plugin manager that is popular to make it easier to install and manage plugins like `lazy.nvim`.

Do not install to many plugins as it can slow down the editor and make it harder to maintain. Only install plugins that you need and use regularly. The 3 plugins mentioned above are a good starting point and cover most of the features you will need or want to work on the HPC.

#### NeoVim distributions
There are many distributions of NeoVim that come pre-configured with plugins and settings but they will be limited on the HPC due to the lack of other required software.
Create and maintain your own configuration to have full control over the editor and to learn more about how it works.

### NeoVim Configuration Step by Step
In this section, we will go through the steps to configure NeoVim on the HPC. We will install NeoVim using conda/micromamba and create a basic configuration file to get started. This will allow you to customize the editor to your liking and add plugins and settings as needed. The configuration will be in Lua format, which is the recommended way to configure NeoVim.


1. Install NeoVim using conda/micromamba.
<!-- tip about installing NeoVim  -->
{%
   include-markdown "work.md"
   start="<!--neovin-install-start-->"
   end="<!--neovin-install-end-->"
%}



2. Create the `~/.config/nvim/` directory.
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim
```

3. Create the `init.lua` file in the `~/.config/nvim/` directory.
```bash
touch ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
```

4. Create the `lua` directory in the `~/.config/nvim/` directory.
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/lua
```
Every file in the `lua` directory can be loaded by NeoVim and will be used to configure the editor.

5. Create the `config` directory in the `~/.config/nvim/lua/` directory.
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/lua/config
```
This directory can be called anything you want, but it is recommended to use a descriptive name to organize your configuration files.

6. Create the `init.lua` file in the `~/.config/nvim/lua/config/` directory.
```bash
touch ~/.config/nvim/lua/config/init.lua
```
This file will be automatically loaded by NeoVim and can contain your custom settings and keybindings.

7. Add the following code to the `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` file to load the configuration files.
```lua
require('config')
```
Since the `config` directory is in the `lua` directory and has a `init.lua` file in it, NeoVim will automatically load the `init.lua` file in the `config` directory.
It is not required to have a `init.lua` file in the `config` directory, it is possible to specify the file to load like this:
```lua
require('config.mappings') -- directory/file.lua
```

8. Add the following code to the `~/.config/nvim/lua/config/init.lua` file to load the other configuration files.
```lua
local modules = {
    -- all the files you want to load
    -- example: 'config.mappings',
    -- example: 'config.options',
    -- example: 'config.plugins',
}

for _, mod in ipairs(modules) do
    local ok, err = pcall(require, mod)
    if not ok then
        error(("Error loading %s...\n\n%s"):format(mod, err))
    end
end
```
This code will load all the files in the `config` directory. You can add more files to the `modules` table to load additional configuration files.

9. Add the following code to the `~/.config/nvim/lua/config/options.lua` file to set some basic options.
```lua
vim.g.mapleader = ' ' -- Leader Key space this will be used for most 
                      --keybindings
vim.g.maplocalleader = ' '

vim.o.clipboard = 'unnamedplus' -- Use the system clipboard

vim.o.number = true -- Show line numbers
-- vim.o.relativenumber = true -- Show relative line numbers

vim.o.signcolumn = 'yes' -- Show the sign column

vim.o.tabstop = 4   -- Number of spaces that a <Tab> in the file counts for
vim.o.shiftwidth = 4 -- Number of spaces to use for each step of (auto)indent

vim.o.updatetime = 300 -- Faster completion

vim.o.termguicolors = true -- Enable true colors

--vim.o.mouse = 'a' -- Enable mouse support
```
There are many options that can be set in NeoVim. The options above are just a few examples of common options that can be set. You can find more options in the NeoVim documentation.

10. Add the following code to the `~/.config/nvim/lua/config/mappings.lua` file to set some basic keybindings.
```lua
-- Shorten function name
local keymap = vim.keymap.set

-- keymap('mode', 'keybinding', 'command', {options})

-- Native keybindings
keymap("n","<leader>s", ":vsp<CR>", {})
keymap("n","<leader>q", ":q<CR>", {})

-- Plugin keybindings
-- NvimTree open/close
keymap("n", "<C-n>", ":NvimTreeToggle<CR>", {})
-- Telescope find files
keymap("n", "<leader>ff", ":Telescope find_files<CR>", {}) 
-- Telescope find word
keymap("n", "<leader>fw", ":Telescope live_grep<CR>", {}) 
```
In this file, you can define custom keybindings for NeoVim. The `keymap` function is used to set keybindings for different modes (normal, insert, visual, etc.). The keybindings above are just a few examples of common keybindings that can be set. 

11. Add the following code to the `~/.config/nvim/lua/config/plugins.lua` file to install and configure plugins.
In this example config lazy.nvim is used to manage plugins.
```lua
local lazypath = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy/lazy.nvim"
if not vim.loop.fs_stat(lazypath) then
    vim.fn.system({
        "git",
        "clone",
        "--filter=blob:none",
        "https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git",
        "--branch=stable", -- latest stable release
        lazypath,
    })
end
vim.opt.rtp:prepend(lazypath)
require('lazy').setup('plugins')
```

Plugins will be loaded form the `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/` directory. This is where you can add the configuration for the plugins you want to use. The `lazy.nvim` plugin manager is used to manage plugins and make it easier to install and update them.

Example of a plugin configuration file for `Telescope.nvim`:
```bash
touch ~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/telescope.lua
```
```lua
return {
    {
        'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim',
        dependencies = { 'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim' }
    },
    {
        'nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim',
        build = 'make',
    }
}
```
This configuration file will install the `Telescope.nvim` plugin and its dependencies. The `telescope-fzf-native.nvim` plugin is a native extension for `Telescope.nvim` that improves performance.

Most plugins will have a example configuration file for `lazy.nvim` that you can use to configure the plugin to your liking. Simply copy the configuration file to the `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/` directory and adjust the settings as needed.

Some plugins like `telecope.nvim` will require additional software to be installed on the HPC to work properly. In this case
the dependencies can be installed using conda/micromamba. The dependencies are [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) and [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) and can be installed like this:
```bash
micromamba install --name editor-env ripgrep
micromamba install --name editor-env fd
```
Don't forget to create an alias for the editor-env in your `.bashrc` file.
```bash
alias ripgrep='micromamba run -n editor-env ripgrep'
alias fd='micromamba run -n editor-env fd'
```

There are many different ways of how to create a NeoVim config everyone does it differently. This is just one way of how to do it. The most important is that you understand how it works and how to configure it to your liking.

## TMUX
[Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to run multiple terminal sessions in a single window. It is useful for managing multiple tasks and keeping them organized. Tmux is pre-installed on most Linux systems and can be used to create and manage multiple terminal windows and panes. It is also available on the HPC and can be used to work more efficiently.

### How to use TMUX
To start a new tmux session, simply type `tmux` in the terminal. This will create a new tmux session with a single window. Now with the help of 
shortcuts you can create new windows and panes. Tmux will have a small status bar at the bottom of the terminal that shows the current session, window, and pane.

Example Picture of TMUX
![tmux](./images/tmux.png)
as you can see in the picture there are 3 panes in the session.

Default keybindings:

- `Ctrl + b` followed by:

    - `c`: Create a new window.
    - `n`: Move to the next window.
    - `p`: Move to the previous window.
    - `0-9`: Move to the window number.
    - `%`: Split the current pane vertically.
    - `"`: Split the current pane horizontally.
    - `x`: Close the current pane.
    - `d`: Detach from the current session.
    - `s`: List all sessions.
    - `$`: Rename the current session.
    - `?`: Show all keybindings.

They can be changed in the `~/.tmux.conf` file.

## Personalizing the Terminal
There are many ways to personalize the terminal to make it more user-friendly and efficient. You can change the color scheme, add custom prompts, and set up aliases and functions to make common tasks easier. Do those configurations at your own risk and make sure to backup the original files before making any changes.
