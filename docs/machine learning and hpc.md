# On-site HPC trainings and tutorials

We propose periodical on-site events for our users. They are free of charge and can be attended by anyone from the University of Luxembourg faculties and interdisciplinary centers. 
Additionally, we also accept users from LIST, LISER and LIH. If you are part of another public research center, please [contact us](mailto:hpc-school-for-beginners@uni.lu).

## Forthcoming events

- HPC School for beginners - March 2025, 12th-13th, 4.320, MSA - Belval Campus
- Machine Learning for beginners - March 2025, 19th-20th, 4.320, MSA - Belval Campus

- ## HPC School for beginners

This event aims to equip you with essential skills and knowledge to embark on your High-Performance Computing (HPC) journey. The event is organized monthly and is composed of two half days (usually 9am-12pm).

Feel free to only attend the second day session if:

- You can connect to the ULHPC
- You are comfortable with the command line interface

Limited spots available per session (20 max).

### Upcoming sessions:

- Date: March 2025, 12th-13th
- Time: 9am to 12pm (both days).
- Location: 4.320, MSA - Belval Campus.

### Morning 1 - Accessing the Cluster and Command Line Introduction 
Learn how to access the HPC cluster, set up your machine, and navigate the command line interface effectively. Gain confidence in interacting with the cluster environment.

### Morning 2 - Understanding HPC Workflow: Job Submission and Monitoring
Explore the inner workings of HPC systems. Discover the process of submitting and managing computational tasks. Learn how to monitor and optimize job performance.


## Machine Learning for beginners

This two-days course introduces participants to Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) on HPC. During the course, we will cover the fundamentals of ML and DL, work through practical exercises on model training, and explore how to speed up computations using HPC resources, distributed computing, and GPU acceleration. The course combines theory, coding exercises, and HPC applications to give participants both a solid foundation and practical skills.

### Upcoming sessions

Limited spots available per session (20 max).

 - Date: March, 2025, 19th-20th.
 - Time: 09:00-12:00 and 13:00-17:00
 - Location: MSA 4.320 - Belval campus
