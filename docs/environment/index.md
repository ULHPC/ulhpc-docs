!!! warning "'-bash: `module`: command not found' on access/login servers"
    Recall that by default, the `module` command is (_on purpose_) **NOT** available on the [access/login servers](../connect/access.md).
    You HAVE to be on a computing node (within a [slurm job](../slurm/index.md))


## Home and Directories Layout

All ULHPC systems use [global home directories](../filesystems/gpfs.md#global-home-directory-home).
You also have access to several other pre-defined directories setup over several different _File Systems_ which co-exist on the ULHPC facility and are configured for different purposes. They are listed below:

## Shell and Dotfiles

The default login shell is `bash` -- see `/etc/shells` for supported shells.

!!! warning "ULHPC dotfiles vs. default dotfiles"
    The ULHPC team **DOES NOT** populate shell initialization files (also known as dotfiles) on users' home directories - the default _system_ ones are used in your home -- you can check them in `/etc/skel/.*` on the [access/login servers](../connect/access.md).
    However, you **may want** to install the [`ULHPC/dotfiles`](https://github.com/ULHPC/dotfiles) available as a [Github repository](https://github.com/ULHPC/dotfiles). See [installation notes](https://github.com/ULHPC/dotfiles#installation).
    A working copy of that repository exists in `/etc/dotfiles.d` on the [access/login servers](../connect/access.md). You can thus use it:
    ```bash
    $ /etc/dotfiles.d/install.sh -h
    # Example to install ULHPC GNU screen configuration file
    $ /etc/dotfiles.d/install.sh -d /etc/dotfiles.d/ --screen -n   # Dry-run
    $ /etc/dotfiles.d/install.sh -d /etc/dotfiles.d/ --screen      # real install
    ```

??? info "Changing Default Login Shell (or NOT)"
    If you want to change your your default login shell, you should set that up using the [ULHPC IPA portal](../connect/ipa.md) (change the Login Shell attribute).
    Note **however that we STRONGLY discourage you to do so.** You may hit unexpected issues with system profile scripts expecting `bash` as running shell.

### System Profile

`/etc/profile` contains Linux system wide environment and startup programs.
Specific scripts are set to improve your ULHPC experience, in particular those set in the [`ULHPC/tools`](https://github.com/ULHPC/tools) repository, for instance:

* [/etc/profile.d/slurm-prompt.sh](https://github.com/ULHPC/tools/blob/master/slurm/profile.d/slurm-prompt.sh): provide info of your running Slurm job on your prompt
* [/etc/profile.d/slurm.sh](https://github.com/ULHPC/tools/blob/master/slurm/profile.d/slurm.sh): several helper function to

### Customizing Shell Environment

You can create dotfiles (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or
`.profile`, etc) in your `$HOME` directory to put your personal shell
modifications.

??? note "Custom Bash Initialisation Files"
    On ULHPC system `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.profile` are sourced by login
    shells, while `~/.bashrc` is sourced by most of the shell invocations
    including the login shells. In general you can put the environment
    variables, such as `PATH`, which are inheritable to subshells in
    `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile` and functions and aliases in the
    `~/.bashrc` file in order to make them available in subshells.
    [`ULHPC/dotfiles` bash
    configuration](https://github.com/ULHPC/dotfiles/blob/master/bash/.bashrc#L469)
    even source the following files for that specific purpose:

    * `~/.bash_private`: custom private functions
    * `~/.bash_aliases`: custom private aliases.

??? info "Understanding Bash Startup Files order"
    See [reference documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Startup-Files.html).
    That's somehow hard to understand. Some tried to explicit it under the form
    of a "simple" graph -- credits for the one below to [Ian
    Miell](https://zwischenzugs.com/2019/02/27/bash-startup-explained/)
    ([another one](http://www.solipsys.co.uk/new/BashInitialisationFiles.html))

    ![](images/bash_startup.png)

    This explains why normally all [ULHPC launcher
    scripts](https://github.com/ULHPC/tutorials/tree/devel/launchers) start with
    the following [sha-bang](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/sha-bang.html) (`#!`)
    header

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash -l
    #
    #SBATCH [...]
    [...]
    ```
    That's indeed the only way (_i.e._ using `/bin/bash -l` instead of the
    classical `/bin/bash`) to ensure that `/etc/profile` is sourced natively,
    and thus that all ULHPC environments variables and modules are loaded.
    _If you don't proceed that way_ (i.e. following the classical approach), you
    **MUST** then use the following template you may see from other HPC centers:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #
    #SBATCH [...]
    [...]
    # Load ULHPC Profile
    if [ -f  /etc/profile ]; then
       .  /etc/profile
    fi
    ```

Since all ULHPC systems share the [Global HOME](../filesystems/home.md) filesystem,
the same `$HOME` is available regardless of the platform.
To make system specific customizations use the pre-defined environment
`ULHPC_CLUSTER` variable:

!!! example "Example of cluster specific settings"

        ```shell
        case $ULHPC_CLUSTER in
            "iris")
                : # Settings for iris
                export MYVARIABLE="value-for-iris"
                ;;
            "aion")
                : # settings for aion
                export MYVARIABLE="value-for-aion"
                ;;
            *)
                : # default value for
                export MYVARIABLE="default-value"
                ;;
        esac
        ```

The ULHPC facility runs [RedHat-based Linux Distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_derivatives), in particular:

* the [Iris cluster](../systems/iris/index.md) run [CentOS](https://centos.org/)  and [RedHat (RHEL)](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/) Linux operating system, **version 7**
* the [Aion cluster](../systems/aion/index.md) run [RedHat (RHEL)](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/) Linux operating system, **version 8**

??? info "Impact of CentOS project shifting focus starting 2021 from CentOS Linux to CentOS Stream"
    You may have followed the [official announcement on Dec 8, 2020](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/) where [Red Hat announced that it will discontinue CentOS 8](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux) by the end of 2021 and instead will focus on CentOS Stream going forward. Fortunately CentOS 7 will continue to be updated until 2024 and is therefore not affected by this change.

    While CentOS traditionally has been a rebuild of RHEL, CentOS Stream will be
    more or less a testing ground for changes that will eventually go into RHEL.
    Unfortunately this means that CentOS Stream will likely become incompatible
    with RHEL (e.g. binaries compiled on CentOS Stream will not necessarily run
    on RHEL and vice versa). It is also questionable whether CentOS Stream is a
    suitable environment for running production systems.

    **For all these reasons, the migration to CentOS 8 for Iris (initially planned for Q1 2021) has been cancelled**.
    _Alternative approaches are under investigation_, including an homogeneous
    setup between Iris and Aion over Redhat 8.
