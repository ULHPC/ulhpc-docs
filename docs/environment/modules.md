# ULHPC Software/Modules Environment

<!--intro-start-->
!!! important ""
    The UL HPC facility provides a large variety of scientific applications to its user community, either domain-specific codes and general purpose development tools which enable research and innovation excellence across a wide set of computational fields. -- see [software list](../software/index.md).

[![](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/Lmod-4color@2x.png){: style="width:200px; margin-right:10px; float: left;"}](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/)

We use the [Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/) / [LMod](http://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) framework which provided the [`module`](http://lmod.readthedocs.io) utility **on Compute nodes**
to manage nearly all software.<br/>
There are two main advantages of the `module` approach:

1. ULHPC can provide many different versions and/or installations of a
   single software package on a given machine, including a default
   version as well as several older and newer version.
2. Users can easily switch to different versions or installations
   without having to explicitly specify different paths. With modules,
   the `MANPATH` and related environment variables are automatically
   managed.

!!! important ""
    **ULHPC modules are in practice automatically generated by [Easybuild](easybuild.md).**

## Environment modules and LMod

[Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/) are a standard and well-established technology across HPC sites, to permit developing and using complex software and libraries build with dependencies, allowing multiple versions of software stacks and combinations thereof to co-exist.

It **brings the `module` command** which is used to manage environment variables such as `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `MANPATH`, enabling the easy loading and unloading of application/library profiles and their dependencies.

??? question "Why do you need [Environment] Modules?"
    When users login to a Linux system, they get a login shell and the [shell](index.md#shell-and-dotfiles) uses Environment variables to run commands and applications. Most common are:

    * [`PATH`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)):  colon-separated list of directories in which your system looks for executable files;
    * [`MANPATH`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/manpath.1.html): colon-separated list of directories in which [`man`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html) searches for the man pages;
    * [`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html): colon-separated list of directories in which your system looks for for ELF / `*.so` libraries at execution time needed by applications.

    There are also _application specific_ environment variables such as `CPATH`, `LIBRARY_PATH`, `JAVA_HOME`, `LM_LICENSE_FILE`, `MKLROOT` etc.

    A _traditional_ way to setup these Environment variables is by [customizing the shell initialization files](index.md#customizing-shell-environment): _i.e._ `/etc/profile`, `.bash_profile`, and `.bashrc`
    This proves to be very impractical on multi-user systems with various applications and multiple application versions installed as on an HPC facility.

    To overcome the difficulty of setting and changing the Environment variables, the TCL/C Environment Modules were introduced over 2 decades ago.
    The [Environment Modules](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/) package is a tool that simplify shell initialization and lets users easily modify their environment during the session with **[modulefiles](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/015_writing_modules.html)**.

    * Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the shell for an application. Once the Modules package is initialized, the environment can be modified on a _per-module_ basis using the `module` command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct the `module` command to alter or set shell environment variables such as `PATH`, `MANPATH`, etc.
    * [Modulefiles](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/015_writing_modules.html) may be shared by many users on a system (as done on the ULHPC clusters) and users may have their _own_ collection to supplement or replace the shared modulefiles.

    Modules can be loaded and unloaded dynamically and atomically, in an clean fashion. All popular shells are supported, including `bash`, `ksh`, `zsh`, `sh`, `csh`, `tcsh`, `fish`, as well as some scripting languages such as `perl`, `ruby`, `tcl`, `python`, `cmake` and `R`. Modules are useful in managing different versions of applications.
    Modules can also be bundled into metamodules that will load an entire suite of different applications -- this is precisely the way we [manage the ULHPC Software Set](../software/swsets.md)

??? info "Tcl/C Environment Modules (Tmod) vs. Tcl [Environment Modules](https://modules.readthedocs.io/) vs. [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/)"
    There exists several implementation of the `module` tool:

    * [Tcl/C Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/) (3.2.10 $\leq$ version < 4), also called `Tmod`: the _seminal_ (**old**) implementation
    * Tcl-only variant of [Environment modules](https://modules.readthedocs.io/) (version $\geq$ 4), previously called `Modules-Tcl`
    * (**recommended**) [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/),  a Lua based Environment Module System
        - Lmod ("L" stands for [Lua](http://www.lua.org/)) provides all of the functionality of TCL/C Environment Modules plus more features:
            * support for _hierarchical_ module file structure
            * `MODULEPATH` is dynamically updated when modules are loaded.
            * makes loaded modules inactive and active to provide sane environment.
            * supports for _hidden_ modules
            * support for _optional_ usage tracking (implemented on ULHPC facilities)
       - In particular, Lmod enforces the following [safety features](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/010_user.html#safety-features) that are not always guaranted with the other tools:
          1. The _One Name Rule_: Users can only have one version active
          2. Users can only load one compiler or MPI stack at a time (through the `family(...)` directive)

    The ULHPC Facility relies on [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/) -- the associated [Modulefiles](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/015_writing_modules.html) being automatically generated by [Easybuild](https://docs.easybuild.io/).

The ULHPC Facility relies on [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/), a Lua-based Environment module system that easily handles the `MODULEPATH` Hierarchical problem. In this context, the `module` command supports the following subcommands:

| Command                        | Description                                                     |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `module avail`                 | Lists all the modules which are available to be loaded          |
| `module spider <pattern>`      | Search for <pattern> among available modules **(Lmod only)**    |
| `module load <mod1> [mod2...]` | Load a module                                                   |
| `module unload <module>`       | Unload a module                                                 |
| `module list`                  | List loaded modules                                             |
| `module purge`                 | Unload all modules (purge)                                      |
| `module display <module>`      | Display what a module does                                      |
| `module use <path>`            | Prepend the directory to the `MODULEPATH` environment variable  |
| `module unuse <path>`          | Remove the directory from the `MODULEPATH` environment variable |

??? question "What is `module`?"
    `module` is a shell _function_ that modifies user shell upon load of a modulefile.
    It is defined as follows
    ```console
    $ type module
    module is a function
    module ()
    {
        eval $($LMOD_CMD bash "$@") && eval $(${LMOD_SETTARG_CMD:-:} -s sh)
    }
    ```
    In particular, **`module` is NOT a program**

At the heart of environment modules interaction resides the following components:

* the `MODULEPATH` environment variable, which defines a colon-separated list of directories to search for modulefiles
* `modulefile` (see [an example](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/100_modulefile_examples.html)) associated to each available software.

!!! danger ""
    (_reminder_): **the `module` command is ONLY available on the compute nodes, NOT on the access front-ends.**<br/>
    In particular, you need to be _within_ a job to load ULHPC or private modules.

## ULHPC `$MODULEPATH`

By default, the `MODULEPATH` environment variable holds a _single_ searched directory holding the optimized builds prepared for you by the ULHPC Team.
The general format of this directory is as follows:

```
/opt/apps/resif/<cluster>/<version>/<arch>/modules/all
```

where:

* `<cluster>` depicts the name of the cluster (`iris` or `aion`). Stored as `$ULHPC_CLUSTER`.
* `<version>` corresponds to the ULHPC Software set release (aligned with [Easybuid toolchains release](https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/master/Common-toolchains.html#component-versions-in-foss-toolchain)), _i.e._ `2019b`, `2020a` etc.  Stored as `$RESIF_VERSION_{PROD,DEVEL,LEGACY}` depending on the Production / development / legacy ULHPC software set version
* `<arch>` is a lower-case strings that categorize the CPU architecture of the build host, and permits to easyli identify optimized target architecture. It is stored as `$RESIF_ARCH`.
    - On Intel nodes: `broadwell` (_default_), `skylake`
    - On AMD nodes: `epyc`
    - On GPU nodes: `gpu`

| Cluster                          | Arch. `$RESIF_ARCH`   | `$MODULEPATH` Environment variable                     |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| [Iris](../systems/iris/index.md) | `broadwell` (default) | `/opt/apps/resif/iris/<version>/broadwell/modules/all` |
| [Iris](../systems/iris/index.md) | `skylake`             | `/opt/apps/resif/iris/<version>/skylake/modules/all`   |
| [Iris](../systems/iris/index.md) | `gpu`                 | `/opt/apps/resif/iris/<version>/gpu/modules/all`       |
| [Aion](../systems/aion/index.md) | `epyc` (default)      | `/opt/apps/resif/aion/<version>/{epyc}/modules/all`    |

* On skylake nodes, you may want to use the optimized modules for `skylake`
* On GPU nodes, you may want to use the CPU-optimized builds for `skylake` (in addition to the `gpu`-enabled softwares)

## Module Naming Schemes

??? question "What is a Module Naming Scheme?"
    The full software and module install paths for a particular software package
    are determined by the _active_ module naming scheme along with the general
    software and modules install paths specified by the EasyBuild configuration.

    You can list the supported module naming schemes of [Easybuild](https://easybuilders.github.io/easybuild-tutorial/hmns/) using:
    ```console
    $ eb --avail-module-naming-schemes
    List of supported module naming schemes:
        EasyBuildMNS
        CategorizedHMNS
        MigrateFromEBToHMNS
        HierarchicalMNS
        CategorizedModuleNamingScheme
    ```
    See [Flat vs. Hierarchical module naming scheme](https://easybuilders.github.io/easybuild-tutorial/hmns/#flat-vs-hierarchical)
    for an illustrated explaination of the difference between two extreme cases: flat or 3-level hierarchical.
    On ULHPC systems, we selected an intermediate scheme called `CategorizedModuleNamingScheme`.

!!! important "Module Naming Schemes on ULHPC system"
    **ULHPC modules are organised through the Categorized Naming Scheme** <br/>
    Format: `<category>/<name>/<version>-<toolchain><versionsuffix>`

This means that the typical module hierarchy has as prefix a **category** level, taken out from one of the supported software category or module _class_:
```console
$ eb --show-default-moduleclasses
Default available module classes:

	base:      Default module class
	astro:     Astronomy, Astrophysics and Cosmology
	bio:       Bioinformatics, biology and biomedical
	cae:       Computer Aided Engineering (incl. CFD)
	chem:      Chemistry, Computational Chemistry and Quantum Chemistry
	compiler:  Compilers
	data:      Data management & processing tools
	debugger:  Debuggers
	devel:     Development tools
	geo:       Earth Sciences
	ide:       Integrated Development Environments (e.g. editors)
	lang:      Languages and programming aids
	lib:       General purpose libraries
	math:      High-level mathematical software
	mpi:       MPI stacks
	numlib:    Numerical Libraries
	perf:      Performance tools
	quantum:   Quantum Computing
	phys:      Physics and physical systems simulations
	system:    System utilities (e.g. highly depending on system OS and hardware)
	toolchain: EasyBuild toolchains
	tools:     General purpose tools
	vis:       Visualization, plotting, documentation and typesetting
```

It follows that the ULHPC software modules are structured according to the organization depicted below (_click to enlarge_).

## ULHPC Toolchains and Software Set Versioning

We offer a **YEARLY** release of the ULHPC Software Set based on Easybuid release of toolchains
-- see Component versions (_fixed per release_) in the  [foss](https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/master/Common-toolchains.html#component-versions-in-foss-toolchain) and [intel](https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/master/Common-toolchains.html#component-versions-in-intel-toolchain) toolchains.
_However_, count at least 6 months of validation/import _after_ EB release before ULHPC release

An overview of the currently available component versions is depicted below:

| __Name__  | __Type__  | 2019(a) (_deprecated_) | __2019b__ (`legacy`)|  __2020a__       | __2020b__ (`prod`) | __2021a__ (`devel`) |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| `GCCCore` | compiler  |                  8.2.0 |               8.3.0 |            9.3.0 |             10.2.0 |              10.3.0 |
| `foss`    | toolchain |                  2019a |               2019b |            2020a |              2020b |               2021a |
| `intel`   | toolchain |                  2019a |               2019b |            2020a |              2020b |               2021a |
| binutils  |           |                 2.31.1 |                2.32 |             2.34 |               2.35 |                2.36 |
| Python    |           |     3.7.2 (and 2.7.15) | 3.7.4 (and 2.7.16)  |3.8.2 (and 2.7.18)|              3.8.6 |               3.9.2 |
| LLVM      | compiler  |                  8.0.0 |               9.0.1 |           10.0.1 |             11.0.0 |              11.1.0 |
| OpenMPI   | MPI       |                  3.1.4 |               3.1.4 |            4.0.3 |              4.0.5 |               4.1.1 |

Once on a node, the current version of the ULHPC Software Set in production is stored in `$RESIF_VERSION_PROD`.
You can use the variables `$MODULEPATH_{LEGACY,PROD,DEVEL}` to access or set the `MODULEPATH` command with the appropriate value. Yet we have define utility scripts to facilitate your quick reset of the module environment, _i.e.,_ `resif-load-swset-{legacy,prod,devel}` and `resif-reset-swset`

For instance, if you want to use the legacy software set, proceed as follows in your launcher scripts:

```bash
resif-load-swset-legacy   # Eq. of export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH_LEGACY
# [...]
# Restore production settings
resif-load-swset-prod     # Eq. of export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH_PROD
```

If on the contrary you want to test the (new) development software set, _i.e.,_ the `devel` version, stored in `$RESIF_VERSION_DEVEL`:

```bash
resif-load-swset-devel  # Eq. of export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH_DEVEL
# [...]
# Restore production settings
resif-reset-swset         # As resif-load-swset-prod
```

??? tips "(iris only) Skylake Optimized builds"
    Skylake optimized build can be loaded on **regular** nodes using
    ```bash
    resif-load-swset-skylake  # Eq. of export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH_PROD_SKYLAKE
    ```
    You **MUST** obviously be on a Skylake node (`sbatch -C skylake [...]`) to take benefit from it.
    Note that this action is **not** required on **GPU** nodes.


!!! tips "GPU Optimized builds vs. CPU software set on GPU nodes"
    On GPU nodes, be aware that the default MODULEPATH holds two directories:

    1. GPU Optimized builds (_i.e._ typically against the `{foss,intel}cuda` toolchains) stored under `/opt/apps/resif/<cluster>/<version>/gpu/modules/all`
    2. CPU Optimized builds (ex: _skylake_ on [Iris](../systems/iris/index.md))) stored under `/opt/apps/resif/<cluster>/<version>/skylake/modules/all`

    You **may want** to exclude CPU builds to ensure you take the most out of the GPU accelerators. In that case, you may want to run:

    ```bash
    # /!\ ADAPT <version> accordingly
    module unuse /opt/apps/resif/${ULHPC_CLUSTER}/${RESIF_VERSION_PROD}/skylake/modules/all
    ```


## Using Easybuild to Create Custom Modules

Just like we do, you probably want to use [Easybuild](../software/easybuild.md) to complete the existing
software set with your own modules and software builds.

See [Building Custom (or missing) software](../software/build.md) documentation
for more details


## Creating a Custom Module Environment

You can modify your environment so that certain modules are loaded
whenever you log in.
Use `module save [<name>]` and `module restore [<name>]` for that purpose -- see [Lmod documentation on User collections](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/010_user.html#user-collections)

You can also create and install your own modules for your convenience or
for sharing software among collaborators.
See the [modulefile documentation](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/015_writing_modules.html) for
details of the required format and available commands.
These custom modulefiles can be made visible to the `module` command by

```
module use /path/to/the/custom/modulefiles
```

!!! warning
    1. 	Make sure the **UNIX** file permissions grant access to all users who want to use the software.
    2. Do not give write permissions to your home directory to anyone else.

!!! note
	The `module use` command adds new directories before
	other module search paths (defined as `$MODULEPATH`), so modules
	defined in a custom directory will have precedence if there are
	other modules with the same name in the module search paths. If
	you prefer to have the new directory added at the end of
	`$MODULEPATH`, use `module use -a` instead of `module use`.

## Module FAQ

!!! question "Is there an environment variable that captures loaded modules?"
    Yes, active modules can be retrieved via `$LOADEDMODULES`, this environment variable is
automatically changed to reflect active loaded modules that is reflected via `module list`.
If you want to access modulefile path for loaded modules you can retrieve via `$_LM_FILES`
