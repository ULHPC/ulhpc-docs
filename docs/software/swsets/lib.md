It features a simple interface for defining unit tests, putting little in the way of the developer. Tests are run in a separate address space, so both assertion failures and code errors that cause segmentation faults or other signals can be caught. Test results are reportable in the following: Subunit, TAP, XML, and a generic logging format.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

This package provides a stripped-down installation of SIONlib for use with performance tools (e.g., Score-P), with renamed symbols to avoid conflicts when an application using SIONlib itself is linked against a tool requiring a different SIONlib version. |

It offers a very wide range of compression/speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast decoder. It also offers a special mode for small data, called dictionary compression, and can create dictionaries from any sample set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
