These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation ("LLVM IR"). The LLVM Core libraries are well documented, and it is particularly easy to invent your own language (or port an existing compiler) to use LLVM as an optimizer and code generator.                                                                                                                 |

For a given list of strings, it produces a hash function and hash table, in form of C or C++ code, for looking up a value depending on the input string. The hash function is perfect, which means that the hash table has no collisions, and the hash table lookup needs a single string comparison only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

It offers a very wide range of compression/speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast decoder. It also offers a special mode for small data, called dictionary compression, and can create dictionaries from any sample set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
