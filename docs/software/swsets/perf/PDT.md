> Program Database Toolkit (PDT) is a framework for analyzing source code written in several programming languages and for making rich program knowledge accessible to developers of static and dynamic analysis tools. PDT implements a standard program representation, the program database (PDB), that can be accessed in a uniform way through a class library supporting common PDB operations.
