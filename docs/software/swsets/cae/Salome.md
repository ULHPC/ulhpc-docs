> The SALOME platform is an open source software framework for pre- and post-processing and integration of numerical solvers from various scientific fields. CEA and EDF use SALOME to perform a large number of simulations, typically related to power plant equipment and alternative energy. To address these challenges, SALOME includes a CAD/CAE modelling tool, mesh generators, an advanced 3D visualization tool, etc.
