The library not only supports writing and reading binary data to or from several thousands of processors into a single or a small number of physical files, but also provides global open and close functions to access SIONlib files in parallel. This package provides a stripped-down installation of SIONlib for use with performance tools (e.g., Score-P), with renamed symbols to avoid conflicts when an application using SIONlib itself is linked against a tool requiring a different SIONlib version.                         |

Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and comparisons.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

One window or font is selected using the command line arguments or possibly in the case of a window, by clicking on the desired window. A list of properties is then given, possibly with formatting information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
