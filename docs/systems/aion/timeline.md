## 2019

### September 2019

* Official Public release of Aion  cluster tenders on [TED](https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:425803-2019:TEXT:EN:HTML&src0=) European tender and [PMP Portal](https://pmp.b2g.etat.lu/?page=entreprise.EntrepriseAdvancedSearch&searchAnnCons&keyWord=190027) (Portail des MarchÃ©s Publics) on Sept 11, 2019
    - __RFP 190027__: Tender for the acquisition of a **Complementary High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster 'Aion'** for the University of Luxembourg.
        * TED Reference: [TED72/2019-608787](https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:425803-2019:TEXT:EN:HTML&src0=)
        * PMP Reference: 1901442

> The RFP is composed of the following Lots:

> *  __Lot 1__:   DLC Computing cluster `aion`.
     - includes cabinets, cooling units (together with any and all required piping and cooling fluids), compute node enclosures and compute nodes blades (dual- socket, relying on x86_64 processor architecture), interconnect elements (Ethernet and InfiniBand) and management servers for the HPC services (including but not limited to operational lifecycle management, Operating System and services deployment, monitoring) tied to this new cluster
     - implementation within one of the University Computer Centre (CDC) server rooms (CDC S-02-004), adjacent to the server room hosting the Iris cluster and its associated storage system), specialized for hosting compute equipment supporting direct liquid cooling through a separate high temperature water circuit, thus guaranteeing unprecedented energy efficiency and equipment density. In the first phase of operation, the system will be connected to the existing cold-water circuit and must be able to operate under these conditions
     - [...]
* __Lot 2__: Adaptation and extension of the existing High-Performance Storage systems
     - includes extension of the existing primary high-performance storage solution featuring a SpectrumScale/GPFS filesystem (based on a DDN GridScaler solution installed as per attribution of the RFP 160019) hosting the user home and project directories, to enable the utilisation of the GPFS filesystem from both existing Iris and new Aion clusters while
     - enabling access to the Lustre-based SCRATCH filesystem (based on a DDN ExaScaler solution installed as per attribution of the RFP 170035) from the new compute cluster is considered a plus. Enhancing and adapting the InfiniBand interconnection to guarantee current performance characteristics while under load from all clients (existing and new compute clusters) is considered a plus.
     - [...]
* __Lot 3__: Adaptation of the network (Ethernet and IB)
     - integration of the new cluster within the existing Ethernet-based data and management networks, which involves the extension and consolidation of the actual Ethernet topology
     - adaptation and extension of the existing InfiniBand (IB) topology to allow for bridging the two networks (Iris "island" and Aion "island")
     - [...]



### October-November 2019

* Bids Opening for both RFPs on October 29, 2019.
    - Starting offers analysis by the ULHPC team, together with the procurement and legal department of the University

### December 2019

* Awarding notification to the vendors
    -  __RFP 190027__ attributed to the **Atos** to provide:
       * _Lot 1_: the new DLC `aion` supercomputer, composed by 318 AMD compute nodes hosted within a compute cell made of 4 BullSequana XH2000 adjacent racks
          - Fast Interconnect: HDR Infiniband Fabric in a Fat tree topology (2:1 blocking)
          - Associated servers and management stack
       * _Lot 2_: Adaptation and extension of the existing High-Performance Storage systems.
           - In particular, the usable storage capacity of the existing primary high-performance storage solution (SpectrumScale/GPFS filesystem) will be extended by 1720TB/1560TiB to reach a total of 4.41 PB
       * _Lot 3_:Adaptation of the network (Ethernet and IB)
