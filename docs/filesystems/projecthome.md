## Project directories `(${PROJECTHOME})`

Project directories are intended for sharing data within a group of researchers, and are stored under the path `/work/projects/<project name>`.

The parent directory of all project directories (`/work/projects`) can be referenced using the environment variable `${PROJECTHOME}`. Use `${PROJECTHOME}` whenever possible as it is guaranteed to point to the parent directory of all project directories.
