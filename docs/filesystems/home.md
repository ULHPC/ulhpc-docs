## Home directory (`${HOME}`)

Home directories provide a convenient means for a user to have access to files such as dotfiles, source files, input files, configuration files regardless of the platform.

Refer to your home directory using the environment variable `${HOME}` whenever possible. The absolute path may change, but the value of `${HOME}` will always be correct.
