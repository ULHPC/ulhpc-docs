## Global Home directory `$HOME`

Home directories provide a convenient means for a user to have access to files such as dotfiles, source files, input files, configuration files regardless of the platform.

Refer to your home directory using the environment variable `$HOME` whenever possible.
The absolute path may change, but the value of `$HOME` will always be correct.
